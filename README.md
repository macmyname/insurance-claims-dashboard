# 📊 Insurance Claims Analysis & Premium Prediction  

##  Data Source: Kaggle

## 🔍 Overview  
This project explores the relationship between **age, BMI, and smoking status** in determining **insurance claim amounts** and applies **predictive modeling** to estimate premiums. Using **Pandas, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn**, I analyzed trends, built machine learning models, and developed a **risk-based premium pricing strategy**.

## 🚀 Features  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover claim amount trends  
- **Correlation Heatmap** for identifying key risk factors  
- **Boxplots & Histograms** to visualize claim distributions  
- **Linear Regression Model** to predict claim amounts  
- **Adjusted Premium Calculation** based on risk factors

## 📈 Key Insights  
✅ **Smokers tend to have higher claim amounts** 💰  
✅ **Age shows a moderate correlation with claims** 📊  
✅ **BMI has a slight impact, but less significant than smoking** 🏥  
✅ **Risk-adjusted premiums** improve pricing fairness
